# Some sites like QVC stream videos and they 
# are not easy to rip. You may want a video
# from one of these sites for your reel.
# In the case of QVC, they have .m3u8 
# playlist files that stream multple .ts
# video files. So we need to take the 
# playlist file, have ffmpeg go through
# it and export an .mp4

# If you don't have ffmpeg downloaded then
# brew install ffmpeg 
# This could take a minute

# Create a directory
mkdir ~/Desktop/test/
cd ~/Desktop/test/
ffmpeg -i "https://fake.com/link-to-m3u8-playlist.m3u8" -c "output.mp4"
# and let it do its thinkg

# Notes:
# I've found some resources that want to use other 
# arguments but the end result is the same for a QVC 
# rip. 
# eg: https://gist.github.com/tzmartin/fb1f4a8e95ef5fb79596bd4719671b5d 
#
# File quality can be an issue on the output
# but something is better than nothing.
