# If you don't have imagemagick downloaded then
# brew install imagemagick 
# This could take a minute

# Create a directory
mkdir ~/Desktop/test/
# Add all your .webp files to that directory
cd ~/Desktop/test/
for file in *.webp
  magick $file ${file//.webp/.jpg}
# and you should have a bunch of jpgs
